# WavPlayerPublic
Welcome to the master branch! The src file will contain all of the written code used to create the Wav Player. Inside the src file, you will find two folders. The folder titled "resources" is simply the song, and image files used to pre-load the songs, and customize the visual appearance of the Wav player. The "package1" file will contain all of the classes used to create the Wav Player. Feel free to look around!
