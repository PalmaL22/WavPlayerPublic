# WavPlayerPublic
Hello! Welcome to a Wav music player that I created using Java Swing and multiple other implementations. Using a Java Layered Panel, the application provides a visually appealing frame, while also ensuring that the application runs efficiently. This Wav player contains pre loaded songs, ready to play at any moment. Test out this project and feel free to listen to any of the six distinct songs provided by the application.

BRANCHES:

Master Branch: The master branch contains all of the necessary classes and files used to create this application. If you wish to learn more about the inner workings of the Wav Player, head to the master branch and check them out.

Jar Branch: The Jar branch contains a runnable JAR file, so that you can easily download it and run it without having to copy down all of the code or files. It is a quick and easy way to test out the application yourself
